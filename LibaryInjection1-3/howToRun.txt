This file is a set of instruction for this question.

1. Compile the benignRandom.c file:
    gcc benignRandom.c -o benignRandom -ldl

2. Run the command: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="."

3.
    Run the following command: gcc --shared -fPIC myLib.c -o ibc.so.6 -ldl  
    This is done in order to compile myLib as a shared libary, with similar name to libc.so.6

4. Execute the following command and find the dynamic section offset the dynstr offset and the debug :         readelf -a ./benignRandom | less

(in my case dynamic section offset is 0x2db0 dynstr is 0x04c8 and debug is 0x15)

5. Install hexedit if not exist, and run hexedit ./benignRandom

6. Find the address that points to libc and change it to something else (need to match ibc so one byte forward)

7. Find the debug, change it to needed and point it to the same location as libc
